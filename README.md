StealthNote is a simple, secure, and offline encrypted text editor built with Python. It allows you to write notes and save them in a fully encrypted `.ectf` format using strong password-based encryption (Fernet + PBKDF2HMAC). Your data never leaves your device.

## 🔐 How It Works

- When you save a note, you're prompted to enter a password.
- Password Strength: Use a strong password to keep it safer.
- The note is encrypted with a random salt + Fernet encryption using your password.
- The resulting `.ectf` file contains both the salt and the encrypted message.
- To open a note, you must enter the same password you used to save it.

## ❗ Disclaimer

The `.ectf` files are **not secure against brute-force attacks** if you choose a weak password. StealthNote uses strong encryption (Fernet + PBKDF2HMAC), but its security entirely depends on the strength of the password you provide.

Always choose a **strong, unique password** — at least 12 characters long, with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

You can test how secure your password is against brute-force attacks by:

- Downloading the included `BruteForceChecker.py` script.
- Trying it with tools like [`RockYou.txt`](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases) to simulate a real-world brute-force attempt.

Your password is the **ONLY** way to decrypt your notes.  
**Do not lose or forget it — there is no password recovery mechanism.**
